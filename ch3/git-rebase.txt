// learning about git rebase

git switch experiment
git rebase master

With the above two commands, git will 
reset the experiment branch to point to the last commit 
on the master branch and then apply the changes (diffs) that were introduced by the 
experiment branch so that once done, the experiment branch will have all the changes on 
the master branch followed by the changes introduced by experiment branch
