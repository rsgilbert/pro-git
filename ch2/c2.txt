// Commit 
// An editor will be opened for you to type a commit message.
git commit 
git commit -v 

// Skip staging area 
git commit -a -m 'skip'

// Remove 
// Remove a commited file 
git rm x.txt 

// Remove only from staging area / index
// Also makes sure the file wont be tracked by git anymore
git rm --cached x.txt 

// Forcefully remove a file that has changes in the index (ie has some changes that were staged and not yet committed)
git rm -f x.txt 
// Then commit 

// Rename / move file 
git mv a.ts b.ts 

// The rename can also be done manually like this:
mv b.ts c.ts 
git add c.ts 
git rm b.ts
